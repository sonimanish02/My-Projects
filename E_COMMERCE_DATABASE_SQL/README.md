# E-Commerce Database Project



##### Project Description



This project is a simulation of a real-world e-commerce database system, designed to showcase end-to-end data architecture and analytics capabilities. The database captures the complete transaction lifecycle â€” from user registration to product purchases, order management, and payment tracking.



Using MySQL as the database engine and the Faker library for synthetic but realistic Indian market data, the system models how an online retail platform stores and manages information. The dataset includes:



1. ###### Users: Customer profiles with demographics and signup details
2. ###### Products: A catalog of popular consumer products with categories and pricing
3. ###### Orders: Records of customer purchases linked to users
4. ###### Order\_Items: Item-level breakdown of each order (quantity and price)
5. ###### Payments: Payment transactions tied to orders with method, status, and date

###### 

The project not only demonstrates database normalization and relational integrity but also enables business insights through SQL queries such as:



* Identifying top-spending customers and repeat buyers
* Tracking best-selling products and revenue-generating categories
* Analyzing order trends and average order values
* Reviewing payment method usage and status distribution



In short, this project provides a blueprint for an e-commerce data backbone that can support analytics, reporting, and decision-making in a retail business scenario.
